    "description":"Absolutely loved this place. Mum and I celebrated her 80th birthday here. Szylvia looked after us, serving a beautiful array of sandwiches, scones and cakes. All very fresh and tasty. When we were leaving I mentioned that it was mum's birthday and the lovely manager let her choose a piece of cake from their delicious selection. I got the deal on Groupon and it was a lovely treat for mum. She also got a brief history lesson on Valerie's. We boxed up what we couldn't eat for the kids to enjoy at home.",
